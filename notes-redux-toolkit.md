1. Redux Toolkit Concepts
    > A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

    > createSlice method accepts an object with 2 things, name and reducers
    # const HomePageSlice = createSlice({
    #    name: "homePage",
    #    reducers: {
    #       
    #    }
    # });
